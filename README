This is a system of makefiles to build coq and the programs it needs.

Quick start for software builders, do once for the users:

      make -C src

Quick start for software users:

      bin/with + bash
      coqide

Add the environment to your .profile, temporary solution:
      
	export PATH=--THISDIR--/bin:$PATH
	export MANPATH=--THISDIR--/share/man:$MANPATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=--THISDIR--/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

where --THISDIR-- is replaced by the path to the directory this file is in,
such as ~univalence/usr, in which case the commands would be
      
	export PATH=~univalence/usr/bin:$PATH
	export MANPATH=~univalence/usr/share/man:$MANPATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~univalence/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
