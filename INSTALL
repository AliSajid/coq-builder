This is a system of makefiles to build coq and the programs it needs.

Quick start for software builders, do once for the users, after putting
this directory tree in the final location:

      make

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hints about specific systems:

   Under Debian 6.0 (date 2012/12) install these optional packages:
      autoconf autotools-dev automake libxml2-dev libgtksourceview2.0-dev

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A possible configure of files in your home directory, assuming /usr/local/hott
is the path to this directory:

   add these symbolic links:

	debian$ cd /usr/local/bin
	debian$ ls -l
	total 0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 16 Dec 19 21:04 coqc -> ../hott/bin/hoqc
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 18 Dec 19 21:04 coqide -> ../hott/bin/hoqide
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 18 Dec 19 21:04 coqtop -> ../hott/bin/hoqtop

   add to .profile:

	PATH=/usr/local/hott/bin:$PATH
	export PATH

   add to .emacs:

	;; Proof General
	(setq load-path 
	      (append
	       '( 
		  "/usr/local/hott/share/emacs/site-lisp" 
		  "/usr/local/hott/share/emacs/site-lisp/ProofGeneral/generic" 
		  )
	       load-path
	       ))
	(load-library "proof-site") ;normally installed in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp
	(custom-set-variables
	  ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
	  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
	  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
	  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
	 '(coq-prog-name "/usr/local/hott/bin/hoqtop"))
	(custom-set-faces
	  ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
	  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
	  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
	  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
	 )
