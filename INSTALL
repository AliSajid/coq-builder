This is a system of makefiles to build coq and the programs it needs.

Quick start for software builders, do once for the users, after putting
this directory tree in the final location:

      make

Here's what happens after you type "make".

   - a file ./README.user is created that explains how to use the resulting
     programs.  In particular, it explains the shell script "with".

   - the compiled programs and associated files are installed in ./encap-2/.
     In certain situations it may be desirable to increment the 2 to 3 so as
     to keep a backup of compiled files on disk.

   - for some packages, links to the compiled files and associated files are
     created in ./bin, ./lib, ./man, ./share, etc.  The purpose of the shell
     script "with" is to set up your environment so the programs can be 
     run correctly.  For example, ./bin is added to your path in fully
     prefixed form.

   - for some packages, links are not created.  The shell script "with"
     can be used to make those available, too.  The appropriate "with"
     command for your favorite purposes can be added to your .profile.

To bypass the making of the default packages and build just the one you want,
do this:

     make -C src install-XXX

where XXX is the source directory of the package.  Example:

     make -C src install-coq83patched

To also get the links created, do this:

     make -C src linkup-XXX

, but beware the possibility of conflicting links from other versions.  If you
want to remove the links for a package YYY, do something like this:

     make -C src unlinkup-YYY

Hints about specific systems:

   Under Debian 6.0 (date 2012/12) install these optional packages:
      autoconf autotools-dev automake libxml2-dev libgtksourceview2.0-dev

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A possible configuration of files in your home directory, assuming
/usr/local/hott is the path to this directory:

   add these symbolic links:

	debian$ cd /usr/local/bin
	debian$ ls -l
	total 0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 16 Dec 19 21:04 coqc -> ../hott/bin/hoqc
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 18 Dec 19 21:04 coqide -> ../hott/bin/hoqide
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 18 Dec 19 21:04 coqtop -> ../hott/bin/hoqtop

   add to .profile:

	PATH=/usr/local/hott/bin:$PATH
	export PATH

   add to .emacs:

	;; Proof General
	(setq load-path 
	      (append
	       '( 
		  "/usr/local/hott/share/emacs/site-lisp" 
		  "/usr/local/hott/share/emacs/site-lisp/ProofGeneral/generic" 
		  )
	       load-path
	       ))
	(load-library "proof-site") ;normally installed in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp
	(custom-set-variables
	  ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
	  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
	  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
	  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
	 '(coq-prog-name "/usr/local/hott/bin/hoqtop"))
	(custom-set-faces
	  ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
	  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
	  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
	  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
	 )
